## Install

Include [Zenscroll](https://github.com/zengabor/zenscroll/archive/latest.zip) into your page. A good place is at the very bottom, just before the closing `</body>` tag. For&nbsp;example:

````html
    ...
    <script src="zenscroll-min.js"></script>
</body>
````

You can also use npm to install Zenscroll:

````
npm install zenscroll
````
