- Scroll to the top of a specific element.
- Scrolling an element into view, making sure both top & bottom are visible, if possible.
- Scroll to an element and center it on the screen.
- Specify the spacing between the element and the edge of the screen (e.g., for fixed navigation bars and footers).
- Customize the duration of the individual scroll operations.
- Callback when the scrolling is done.
- Can use new browser’s built-in smooth-behavior if it’s enabled.
