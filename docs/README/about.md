## About

Zenscroll is a vanilla JavaScript module that enables animated vertical scrolling to any element or any position within your document or within a DIV or other scrollable container.

Features:

- Animated scrolling to anchors on the same page (unless the browser natively supports it and itâ€™s enabled).
- Scroll to the top of a specific element.
- Scrolling an element into view, making sure both top & bottom are visible, if possible.
- Scroll to an element and center it on the screen.
- Customize the duration of the individual scroll operations.
- Specify the spacing between the element and the edge of the screen (e.g., for fixed navigation bars and footers).
